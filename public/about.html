<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Climbing, cooking, gaming, and politics.</p>

<p>From a young age, I was really into progressive leftist politics, until I discovered the writing of Murray Rothbard
  and the field of the Austrian School of Economics. </p>

<p>Cooking has always been something I've been interested in, but as I got a chance to work in a full service kitchen, I
  realized this was a profession that I could really become passionate about, especially in the field of vegan cooking.
</p>
<p>Gaming was always something I did from an early age. With the advent of twitch and online gaming communities, it's
  continued to be a passion of mine. I currently stream four days a week in addition to my full time job.</p>
<p>Climbing came later in life. I heard a coworker making plans to go to a bouldering gym and asked if I could join him.
  Ever since that day, I've been obsessed. I go climbing twice a week and my social media has been inundated with
  climbing videos.</p>
